      <p class="gamebody">This is how the game looks with no mods installed. While it may have looked good in 2006 by our current standards 
      it looks ancient and leaves a lot to be desired. Most of the Icons are low resolution and the textures aren’t really 
      the best quality. It pretty much looks like a mobile game.</p>

      <p>My favorite game of all time has to be Star Wars Empire at War. It is an RTS game that came out around 2006. 
      Unlike most movie based video games this one was actually a success. It has both land and space battles which I 
      think is really neat since most strategy games that I have seen only feature one type of battle. In my opinion it 
      is still has some of the best space battles of any strategy game to date. I’ve been playing this game since I was 
      6 years old and it has been a big part of my childhood. The game has aged quite a bit and it shows but it has a 
      very active community that has kept it alive through modding over the years. The mods are the best part of the game 
      and some of them completely change how the game looks and completely overhaul it's visuals. I do still enjoy playing 
      the game without mods but at this point I have over 1000 hours in total logged into this game so I usually end up 
      modding the game.</p>

      <h2>EAW Remake Mod</h2>
      <img class="imageR" id="sideimager" src="images/eaw2.jpg" alt="Star Wars Empire at War with remake mod">
      <p class="gamebody">This is Empire At War with the Remake Mod installed. The difference is night and day. The visuals are far superior 
      and there are many new effects that simply did not exist when the game was made back in 2006. There are also many new 
      ships that are in the Remake mod that were not present in the original game. Mods such as this one are basically complete 
      overhauls of the game. It honestly feels like you're playing a completely different game.</p>
