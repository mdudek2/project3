    <p id="bspacer1">My favorite book of all time would have to be The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. I really enjoyed the dystopian setting and I thought that the concept of a bunch of
    people being forced into a large arena to fight for the entertainment of others was very interesting. I bought this book when I was in 6th grade at my school's bookstore
    and I finished it in a single 6 hour reading session. I simply could not put it down no matter how hard I tried, and while I did enjoy the other two books in the series I feel
    that The Hunger Games is by far the best out of the three by far.</p>
    <p id="bspacer2">Another book that I really enjoyed was Of Mice and Men. I was required to read this book over the summer for my high school english class and I originally hated it, but
    as time went on I realized that it was actually a really good book about loneliness and about how many people never really get to live out their dreams. To this day the
    ending makes me cry because I just can't help but feel bad for both George and Lenny. I can't imagine what it must be like having to shoot your best friend.</p>
    <p id="bspacer3">I was originally introduced to The Witcher because of the games. I absolutely loved the story and the world in The Witcher 3, so I decided to give the books a try.
    I ended up liking the book even more than I liked the game. The Last Wish focuses on Geralt who is a witcher. A witcher is basically just a person who has been mutated
    in order to make them faster, stronger, and much more dangerous than a normal human so that they can fight monsters. These mutations also have the added side affect of
    taking away a persons emotions. The book is essentially a collection of short stories about Geralt taking on jobs and killing monsters for money. However there is more to
    it than that. The book also incorporates many moral dillemas and uses them to teach important moral lessons. One of the most important of these lessons is that there is not
    always a morally correct choice in life. Sometimes no matter what you do you will end up having to choose between two evils.</p>
